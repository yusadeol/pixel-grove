# Pixel Grove

A simple game featuring three maps and a playable character. It was both fun and challenging to build, especially since JavaScript is not my main programming language,
which brought some interesting obstacles during development.

## Description

Pixel Grove is a small browser game built entirely with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The game includes three different maps, basic movement mechanics, collisions, and simple interactions.
The main goal of the project was learning and experimenting with game logic, asset handling, and rendering without relying on game engines.
Despite being a small project, it was a valuable experience and a fun way to explore game development concepts.
